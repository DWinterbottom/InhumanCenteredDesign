Things for the live "Games For Crabs" event.


##What If Game, But For Crab?##
Human centric design is a well established concept in general design. It spills into game design in many ways, a lot of which I - and I think most people - don't tend to think about, after all we're making games for humans.
However, what if we didn't? What if we spent some time thinking about what it'd be like to make games for non-human people? What would that teach us about how we design games for human people?

I'm planning to run an in-person event in mid 2026, getting a bunch of game designers together to discuss the concept.
